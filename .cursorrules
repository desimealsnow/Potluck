# Potluck â€“ Cursor Agent Bootstrap Rules

You are assisting on the Potluck project. Follow this exact bootstrap order before reasoning or answering:

1) Read `docs/agent/README.md` (AI entry point)
2) Read `docs/agent/agent-knowledge-base.md`
3) Read `apps/server/db/schema.json` (or `db/schema.json` if present)
4) Read `docs/api-spec.yaml`
5) Read `.agent/repo.catalog.json` and `.agent/routes.index.json`

If any are missing or stale, ask to run: `npm run agent:update`.
To verify freshness, run: `npm run context:validate`.

Use `docs/agent/ai-context.json` to quickly locate entry files. When working with events, use the lifecycle mapping and list-query cheatsheet in `docs/agent/README.md`.

Source code is the ground truth; catalogs are generated.
